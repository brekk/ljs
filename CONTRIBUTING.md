## Contributing

_Disclaimer:_ As this project is a fork of an existing (seemingly [unmaintained](https://github.com/phadej/ljs/pulse)) [library](https://github.com/phadej/ljs), the direction has changed slightly.

In the spirit of the original [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/phadej/ljs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md):

Take care to maintain the existing coding style (as maintained by eslint). Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code.
